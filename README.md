## K_Sort Algorithm

The K_Sort algorithm is a sorting technique specifically tailored for stacks. It efficiently sorts a stack of integers by intelligently manipulating the stack operations, such as pushing, popping, and swapping elements. This algorithm focuses on minimizing the number of required operations, resulting in optimal sorting performance.
