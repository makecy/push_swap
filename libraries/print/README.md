# ft_printf

Welcome to ft_printf, my 42 project where I crafted a custom printf function, mirroring the behavior of the original C standard library printf.

## Overview
This project challenges coding finesse, requiring a meticulous recreation of printf's functionality with precision and accuracy.

## Features
- Custom implementation of printf
- Mirrors behavior of C standard library printf
- Focus on coding accuracy and finesse

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the project: `make`
3. Integrate `ft_printf` into your code
4. Explore and leverage the custom printf function
