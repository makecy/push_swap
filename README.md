# push_swap

Welcome to Push_swap, a 42 project designed to test your sorting algorithm skills efficiently.

# Overview
Master the art of sorting a stack of integers using a minimal set of operations, showcasing your algorithmic prowess.

## Features
- Efficient sorting alrogithm
- Minimization of operations
- Implementation in C
- Developed within specified constraint
- Integral part o the 42 coding school curriculum

## Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Compile the program: make
3. Run the program with a list of integers as arguments
4. Follow the output instructions to observe optimal sorting

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Let's collaborate to optimize sorting algorithms and enhance problem-solving skills.

Happy coding,
Martin Stefanoski.
